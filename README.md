# Severance: An Existential Mystery

The minimalist, late 90s aesthetic of the office buildings depicted in Severance hides a futuristic technology. While it doesn't make clear what Lumon Industries truly does, its entire business model is based on the memory-splitting process known as severance.  The company was created by a mythical figure called Kier Egan that those at Lumon must revere and worship.  As a new employee joins the Microdata Refinement department, we gradually learn what the severance process is, and why it's so sinister.  Severance slowly reveals how Luman Industries' severance process works, with each new revelation being more sinister than the previous one.

## How The Lumon Employees' Memories Are Split In Severance

### The Severance Process Includes Brain Surgery And A Chip

The daunting process of severance colleagues are subjected to has more than just one step. Initially, the employees who decide to take the job must undergo a surgical procedure in which a chip is introduced inside their brains. The science behind the small device is not exactly explained, but it is possible to infer that it somehow forks neural receptions into two paths: one for everything related to the personal life and another for everything related to the work life. In other words, an innie and an outie are created.

Given the seriousness of the process, Lumon Industries employees must record a video before undergoing the surgery. They confirm they are in agreement with the terms and assure their innies that they have agreed to join the company. The process of severance, however, does not end on the operating table. It is when Lumon Industries' employees take the elevator down into the office building that Severance's memory switch happens.

As a result, the entrance and exit of Lumon Industries employees can only happen in a staggered way. Additionally, those at Lumon can remotely activate the chip even when the workers are not in the Lumon building. This is called overtime contingency and is unknown to most people. It is thanks to the overtime contingency protocol that outies are able to "wake up" the other people.

The employees can choose whether or not to join the company, but getting out of there is a lot more complicated.

## How Much Freedom Severance's Employees Really Have

### The Innies Aren't Treated As Real People

The fact that the severance process is voluntary and that employees wishing to work at Lumon Industries must state on video that they are authorizing the procedure gives a false impression of freedom. The employees can choose whether or not to join the company, but getting out of there is a lot more complicated. Although the employees can hand in resignation letters, they are never accepted. Also, the work self cannot send any kind of message to their outside self. When tried, the mysterious elevator quickly detected it and called security.

Discussions about whether the two separate consciousnesses make for two different people are complex. Either way, the possibility of ceasing to exist causes the employees to be trapped inside Lumon Industries' small departments. When someone retires or is fired by Lumon, their innie essentially dies. The only known case of a person whose memories were reintegrated, died shortly after reaching out.

## Why People Choose To Undergo The Severance Process

### Each Person Had Their Reason To Work At Lumon

Although it seems strange that someone would agree to participate in a process as frightening as that of Severance, some believed they had good enough reason.   Suffering from depression some believed that disconnecting from the "real world" for eight hours a day would help deal with grief.  Another became the perfect marketing asset for Lumon in terms of politics, as the country was discussing whether or not it should continue. There is a powerful lobby for and against severance, which is why there's a big role to play in the mission of promoting it.

It is plausible that they are also going through difficult times in their personal lives and have sought some way to alleviate their struggles. Another possibility still is that Lumon Industries pays a much higher salary than any other company from the same area, prompting people to take the job despite the severance process.

## Why Severance Is Terrifying

### Lumon Is Even More Sinister Than It Seems

The above-mentioned points show just how frightening the truth behind Lumon Industries is. Although the entire premise of the series is based on futuristic technology, the discussions that Severance proposes tie into real issues of the contemporary world. How truly free a person is in the face of an oppressive work system, the loss of individuality in exchange for production, and how personal information is being handled by companies are some of the elements common to both Severance and the real world. Severance is about the present, not the future.

## Severance's Neurological Procedure

### Severance Used A Real-Life Neurosurgeon As A Consultant

Severance's creators brought in a real neurosurgeon in an attempt to make it as realistic as possible. His job was to balance what neuroscience currently knows about the human brain and things it expects to find out in the future.  While technology is still not at the stage depicted in Severance, it is not far off from it either. The doctor discussed how neurosurgeons have managed to add microcatheters into the brain and use them to adjust things like movement and tremors.  What the public may not be aware of is that we are much closer to this type of technology and this ability than we have ever been before.

By specifically targeting certain areas of the brain with electric pulses by Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery chief cited the example of a paraplegic patient who performed a ceremonial first kickoff using a robotic suit that was controlled by his brain. The case illustrated that, right now, neuroscience research is focused on helping people who have trouble with movements. Still, society is now much closer to the technology shown in Severance than ever.

## Every Severed Person In Severance

### The Microdata Refinement Division

Although Lumon has a couple of departments, Severance focuses primarily on the Microdata Refinement team, the department was down one member following an exit. To replace him, Lumon brought in someone who serves as the point of view person.

Severance showed several things at once, including how cult-like devotion is when her innie activated outside the building and she has no idea how to navigate her life in the real world because she isn't aware of her outie's life and structure. This blending of the innie and outie world sets up either a hero in bringing the company down or a villain, depending on intentions.

What makes this interesting is that she was willing to go through the procedure voluntarily, which shows how deep this company's cult-like thinking goes. She feels she has to prove her worth and value to her ancestors, and that makes it disturbing to use someone as a guinea pig in this situation. However, this could also lead to another twist since she has the most to gain and to lose of anyone in the program, and her story should lead Severance into even more interesting directions.

## Severance Isn't The Only Reason Lumon Is Scary

### The Company Somehow Faked Death

The idea of Lumon using these procedures for their employees is a scary proposition in itself. However, the company is a lot scarier than that because they have the power to influence things outside their walls. This was shown with the major twist of what happened.  It was still a jaw-dropping moment when it was shown that his wife was supposed to be dead.

Lumon somehow concocted her death, and that shows that the company has a lot more power than just making its employees unaware of their outside lives while at work.  They had no idea about the truth about the outie's wife until she wasn't dead, but was working for Lumon.  She shows almost no emotion and is robotic, and she has no memories of her outie life. Lumon holds much more power on Severance than anyone might have believed.

Severance is a psychological thriller featuring an employee at Lumon Industries who undergoes a "severance" procedure to separate his work and personal memories. However, as work and life personas mysteriously begin to collide, it quickly becomes clear that not all is as it seems.

## Severance: What Exactly Does Lumon Industries Do?

### No one really knows what Lumon Industries does

The severance process is not the only big mystery in Severance. The overly complicated work environment placed in a huge building belies the fact that no one really knows what Lumon Industries does. Cosmetics, tech equipment, pharmaceuticals, data mining, ocean cleaning, or movie censorship are some of the hypotheses raised byÂ the cast of Persons in Severance, but the truth is that no one is sure of what the company does.

Despite all of that mystery, Lumon Industries seems to be pretty well known in the world of Severance. That makes it even more strange that no one knows for sure what the company does.  For what appears to be one of the biggest companies in the world of Severance, it is pretty scary that no one knows what Lumon Industries does. Even the employees in the microdata management department, which in itself is a pretty generic job description, don't know what the numbers on their screens mean. The real answer will probably only be found at the end, but it must be related to why Lumon Industries splits the memories of its employees.

For what appears to be one of the biggest companies in the universe of Severance, it is pretty scary that no one knows what Lumon Industries does.

## Severance's Lumon Has Some Disturbing Real World Tech Company Parallels

### Lumon Industries mirrors real-world tech giants

It is not easy to label Severance's Lumon Industries as one specific type of business, but there are several similarities between the mysterious company and real-world tech giants. In Severance, those who work for Lumon Industries are viewedÂ with both prestige and suspicion by society at large due to the company's controversial severance process. AmongÂ Lumon's employees is the main Person of Severance, who works in the almost secret department for severed workers.

While much has yet to be revealed about what or who is behind Lumon Industries, a few clues here and there help to better understand what's happening inÂ Severance. The memory switch process most likely has a better motive than just increasing productivity, and it may be hiding a terrifying truth about Severance. In addition to all the show's mystery, what has already been seen about Lumon makes it possible to draw a series of parallels between the fictional world and famous real-life work environments.

The similarities between Lumon and real-world tech companies range from architecture to daily work practices. Lumon Industries'Â hyperbolicallyÂ wide,Â multi-level building resembles real landscrapes,Â even though the main events of the show actually take place on a much more reserved basement floor. The department in which the colleagues work is extremely flat, almost claustrophobic, with no source of natural light, creating an interesting duality. Lumon has an entire complex available, and yet the most important projects in the company might be taking place in a much simpler and more secretive environment.

Another interesting point of comparison is that there seems to be no definition of what Lumon Industries actually produces. Lumon is said to work in cosmetics, drugs, and technology, and no one can really categorize the company into one specific business model. The vastness of products and services that the same giant company can be involved with, and how dangerous that can be, is one of the parallels Severance draws with the real world. Another parallel that does not go unnoticed is the idea of citizens protesting against a particular practice of a large company. In Severance, it's due to the memory switch process. In the real world, the reasons are unfortunately uncountable - and, thus, unaccountable.

The possibility of drawing parallels between fiction and the real world is one of the reasons why the story has worked so well, and Severance proves it by taking inspiration from real-life tech companies to create its world. Lumon Industries' questionable decisions represent to the world of Severance and its persons what tech giants do to the real world, and that allows for interesting discussions to be made. Like every great story, Severance's main themes may not be its futuristic premise but instead something deeper and more relevant to contemporary culture.

Comparing Severance's Lumon to one type of business isn't easy, but there are many similarities between the fictional company and real-world tech giants.

## Lumon's Creator Could Be The Key To Mysteries

### The creator of the Severance process is never shown

Severance's Lumon Industries is clearly hiding many secrets, and the truth behind the company's creator may be the key to them all.  One of few people who accepted to participate in the severance process of what is one of the biggest yet mysterious companies in that universe. Produced and directed by Ben Stiller, Severance has already proved that it will be the type of show whose each episode will leave a good amount of clues for viewers to pick up.

Severance's frightening premise deals with a company whose employees in certain departments must undergo a frightening process in which their personal memories are separated from their working memories. Thus, none of the co-workers have any idea who they are outside the small departments of Lumon Industries. Likewise, none of them have any idea of what or who they work with once they leave the building. By making it so that not even the memories of its main people can be trusted, Severance creates a tense atmosphere in which any narrator could be an unreliable one. That makes the truth about Lumon Industries' secrets way more difficult to be uncovered.

One of those secrets is who's really behind Lumon Industries. Upon entering the large but sparsely populated company building, employees can see a huge and imposing portrait of the face of Kier Egan, the man who appears to have been the creator of Lumon Industries. As if the glorious portrait right in the middle of the building wasn't enough, the people in Severance have as a daily task to praise this portrait of Kier Egan. At no point, however, it is made clear whether this Kier Egan is still alive, what his contribution to Lumon Industries really was, and whether he was the one who came up with the idea of the severance process.

It is curious that in addition to the lack of information about what Lumon Industries actually does, with people making assumptions ranging from cosmetics to ocean cleaning, little is also known about the company's creator. The almost ritual of worship of the mysterious figure of Kier Egan that the employees must perform every day hides the fact that Severance's employees most likely don't know anything about the man they theoretically work for. In fact, considering all the lies surrounding Lumon Industries, Kier Egan might not even exist. This would be another similarity between Severance and real life, as both deal with a workplace that follows unreal figures.

Finding out more about the true creator of Lumon Industries is key to understand the real truth behind Severance's biggest secrets. 

## Severance: Why Lumon's Severance Departments Are So Small

### It's strange that its employees work in such small departments - but they're small on purpose.

People employed in the labyrinthine basement of Lumon go through the process of "severance" in the elevator ride down to their office, transitioning from their personal or "outie" self to their "innie" work self. After walking through disorienting white hallways, work in the Macrodata Refinement department with coworkers they work in a two-by-two cubicle arrangement in the middle of a relatively large space.

Even in a corporation as large as Lumon, smaller-sized departments aren't necessarily unheard of. However, the wasted space and isolation suggests that the department sizes are small by design. Lumon's unusually extensive measures of secrecy ensure that their severed employees'Â innie selves don't try to sabotage company protocol. It's incredibly difficult to quit a severed position - severance is a permanent procedure - and the employees are unaware of their job's purpose to the company. In order for everyone to follow the litany of rules and regulations, the department holds itself accountable. A few extremely close employees that regard themselves as family can keep track of each other better than a larger department made up of work acquaintances.

Lumon enacts serious punishments for employees that break even minor protocols. Employees trying to send messages to their outie selves on the elevator set off alarms and are taken to the "break room,"Â where they must agonizingly recite a script apologizing for their wrongdoings. The department's superior is a looming force spying on the basement departments and takes necessary action for any disturbances. Because even though minute disturbances are punished, Lumon needs smaller department sizes to optimize liability.

It's still unknown how many people are severed at Lumon, or how many basement departments exist. However,Â the departments' small and close-knit nature despite the basement's clear capacity to employ more people signifies the importance of extreme accountability in Lumon's more classified spaces.Â SeveranceÂ is yet to reveal further details about Lumon, but there's a lotÂ expressed about the company by the four-person Macrodata Refinement department.

## Severance: What Lumon's Numbers Mean

### Theories on what the numbers actually mean.

The meaning behind the numbers Lumon employees are hired to sort indicate a few theories based on clues. In Severance, the "innies" spend their days cataloging numbers based on their emotional reactions to them, but the origin of the Lumon numbers is never revealed (nor are the reasons the innies react to the Severance numbers at all). Severance exaggerates the arbitrariness of the office by offering its employees no explanation for the necessity of mundane tasks. All the Lumon employees know is that they must sort numbers that evoke an emotional reaction into folders. They meet quotas, try to finish number files before they expire, and receive rewards for reaching quotas that include erasers, finger traps, and waffle parties.

Still, sorting numbers and meeting quotas doesn't fully satisfy a sense of accomplishment at work. The main peoples' innies don't seem to know exactly what Severance's Lumon Industries do, much less what the Lumon numbers signify. Still, they make theories ranging from believing that they're cleaning the ocean for a mass human migration to innocently thinking that they're eradicating swear words from movies. Clues regarding Lumon's staunch philosophies, and airtight control of its employees, make both suggestions unlikely, but there are still plenty of theories about what the numbers really mean. A common thread through all of these ideas is that Lumon isn't actually interested in the numbers at all â what matters is how the employees react to them.

## Employees Aren't Actually Archiving Lumon's Data

### The mystery around Lumon's numbers is so deep that few explanations would feel sufficient

The numbers are a perfect metaphor for the kind of meaningless make-work that so many office workers spend their days on, and explaining their purpose could ruin this. Other fictional stories have struggled when they have to provide concrete explanations for their atmospherically rich mysteries. Severance will surely have to answer some questions, but it should also still leave some elements of the world mysterious, and the numbers could be one of these elements.

Look for the resolution of some of Severance's mysteries.  A bold move would be for Severance to continue to not explain what the numbers mean. While some may find this frustrating, the mystery around Lumon's numbers is so deep that few explanations would feel sufficient.
